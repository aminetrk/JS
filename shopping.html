  <h1>Project 3</h1>

  <h2>Questions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Name a situation where you would need to create an "if" statement. (There are many answers to this question.)</li>
    <li>When comparing values, in what data type is the result stored? (number, string, or Boolean?)</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Answers</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Using if statements is essential for validating user input or checking correctness. For example, if a user tries to enter an invalid name when asking for their name, JavaScript will return incorrect data, and we donâ€™t want that.</li>
    <li>When comparing values, the data type returned is a Boolean value (true or false).</li>
  </ol>
