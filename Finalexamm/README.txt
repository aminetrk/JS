I chose a Personal Budget / Expense Tracker because I want to practice watching my own spending and it is something many people use in real life. I built the page with HTML and CSS for the layout and style, and I used JavaScript for variables, functions, events, conditionals, and DOM changes. The user types in their income and expenses, and the script calculates totals, shows how much money is left, and displays simple messages and tips about their budget.
